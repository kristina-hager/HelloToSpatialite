# HelloToSpatialite

Attempt to create a 'hello world' app using spatialite for android

The goal is that this app will use the android lib https://github.com/kristina-hager/Spatialite-Database-Driver
so you will also need to get a copy of that lib and put it in a parallel directory to this example:

`git clone https://github.com/kristina-hager/Spatialite-Database-Driver.git`

I will write more as I get this example working!
